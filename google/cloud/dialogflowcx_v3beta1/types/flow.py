class Flow(proto.Message):
    r"""Flows represents the conversation flows when you build your
    chatbot agent.
    A flow consists of many pages connected by the transition
    routes. Conversations always start with the built-in Start Flow
    (with an all-0 ID). Transition routes can direct the
    conversation session from the current flow (parent flow) to
    another flow (sub flow). When the sub flow is finished,
    Dialogflow will bring the session back to the parent flow, where
    the sub flow is started.

    Usually, when a transition route is followed by a matched
    intent, the intent will be "consumed". This means the intent
    won't activate more transition routes. However, when the
    followed transition route moves the conversation session into a
    different flow, the matched intent can be carried over and to be
    consumed in the target flow.

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            The unique identifier of the flow. Format:
            ``projects/<Project ID>/locations/<Location ID>/agents/<Agent ID>/flows/<Flow ID>``.
        display_name (str):
            Required. The human-readable name of the
            flow.
        description (str):
            The description of the flow. The maximum
            length is 500 characters. If exceeded, the
            request is rejected.
        transition_routes (Sequence[google.cloud.dialogflowcx_v3beta1.types.TransitionRoute]):
            A flow's transition routes serve two purposes:

            -  They are responsible for matching the user's first
               utterances in the flow.
            -  They are inherited by every page's [transition
               routes][Page.transition_routes] and can support use cases
               such as the user saying "help" or "can I talk to a
               human?", which can be handled in a common way regardless
               of the current page. Transition routes defined in the
               page have higher priority than those defined in the flow.

            TransitionRoutes are evalauted in the following order:

            -  TransitionRoutes with intent specified..
            -  TransitionRoutes with only condition specified.

            TransitionRoutes with intent specified are inherited by
            pages in the flow.
        event_handlers (Sequence[google.cloud.dialogflowcx_v3beta1.types.EventHandler]):
            A flow's event handlers serve two purposes:

            -  They are responsible for handling events (e.g. no match,
               webhook errors) in the flow.
            -  They are inherited by every page's [event
               handlers][Page.event_handlers], which can be used to
               handle common events regardless of the current page.
               Event handlers defined in the page have higher priority
               than those defined in the flow.

            Unlike
            [transition_routes][google.cloud.dialogflow.cx.v3beta1.Flow.transition_routes],
            these handlers are evaluated on a first-match basis. The
            first one that matches the event get executed, with the rest
            being ignored.
        transition_route_groups (Sequence[str]):
            A flow's transition route group serve two purposes:

            -  They are responsible for matching the user's first
               utterances in the flow.
            -  They are inherited by every page's [transition route
               groups][Page.transition_route_groups]. Transition route
               groups defined in the page have higher priority than
               those defined in the flow.
